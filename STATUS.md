# ParaLLang status

The entry point for agents: the current state, how the project is logged, and the round index.

## Current state (2026-10-31)

- **Built.** The Phase 2 Language Engine loop at The Coffee Cart in The Crumbling Market: Gerald the Imp's
  encounter, companion help, the Spellbook and spaced review ([round 001](docs/rounds/001/architecture.md)). It is
  playable through a Codex or Claude Code subscription CLI ([round 002](docs/rounds/002/architecture.md)).
- **Design sources.** [`parallang.md`](parallang.md) (vision and lore), [`prototype.md`](prototype.md) (technical
  blueprint) and [`parallang_obsidian/`](parallang_obsidian/Parallang.md), the owner's Obsidian notes on design,
  lore, characters, locations and quests. The notes are a copy of the vault in `~/Documents/Parallang`, taken
  2026-10-31.
- **Language.** Italian is the default target language; Spanish is still available. `TARGET_LANGUAGE` (`it` or
  `es`) selects a pack under `content/languages/`, and each language has its own Spellbook
  ([round 003](docs/rounds/003/architecture.md)).
- **App first.** Development is iPhone-first: the Expo / React Native app in `mobile/` plays the same loop and is
  tested in the iOS Simulator against the local server (`npm run dev:server`, `npm run dev:ios`). The web client in
  `client/` is frozen: it is kept working, but new features go to the app ([round 004](docs/rounds/004/architecture.md)).
- **Next.** The owner plays the app in the Simulator and reviews the Italian content
  ([round 004 open items](docs/rounds/004/findings.md#open-items),
  [round 003 open items](docs/rounds/003/findings.md#open-items)).

## Addendum 2026-10-31: round 004, iPhone app first

Round 004 moved development to an Expo / React Native iPhone app in `mobile/`, built alongside round 003 in a
separate worktree and rebased onto it. Codex critique 1 (10 findings) was accepted in full. Mobile tests pass
(15/15), as does `expo-doctor` (20/20); the frozen web client still passes 12/12 and builds. Every live step ran in
an iPhone 17 Simulator with the Codex CLI provider: a word and a sentence revealed, a due review answered, the order
resolved, the server-down message shown with the reply kept. Pronunciation was confirmed only as far as iOS speech
synthesis starting. The live run found two problems, both fixed: Expo now serves on localhost, and
`server/nodemon.json` stops learner saves from restarting `npm run dev:server` (an owner-approved Amendment). See
[findings](docs/rounds/004/findings.md).

## Addendum 2026-10-31: lore notes, Journathan and infohazards

Owner-requested additions to the design notes, made in `parallang_obsidian/` and synced into the vault at
`~/Documents/Parallang`. New character Journathan, a hero of old modelled on Odysseus, whose legend is *The Journey*
(`CHARACTERS.md`). The Pratchett style section now adds a contemporary meme-culture layer (`GAME MECHANICS.md`). A new
Infohazards lore subsection draws on Lovecraft and Pratchett (classic) and SCP (modern): dangerous memes native to the
foreign realm that breach through the strings (`LORE.md`). The notes are cross-linked with Obsidian wikilinks. The
game's tone files (`content/narration/style_guide.yaml`, `content/characters/enemies/imp_coffee.yaml`) still describe
the Pratchett-only tone.

## Addendum 2026-10-31: round 003, Italian by default

Round 003 was the first round recorded with the round log. It made the target language configurable, with Italian
as the default and Spanish kept. Codex critique 1 (14 findings) was accepted in full. Tests pass: server 65/65 and
client 12/12. A live Codex run in Italian passed 9/9 cases and resolved the encounter. Open items: the owner's review
of the Italian content, and a manual browser pass. See [findings](docs/rounds/003/findings.md).

## How the project is logged

| Record | Where | Form | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Status** | This file | Current state, dated addenda (newest first) and the round index | One addendum per piece of work |
| **Design decisions** | `docs/rounds/NNN/architecture.md` | Goal, owner decisions, Second opinion, design, tests (pre-run); dated Amendments, Status and Outcome | Rounds 001–002 ran through the round pipeline (`packet.md`, `implement.md`, `audit-1`, `fix-1`, `verify-1`, `round.json`). From round 003, conversational rounds are recorded with the `round-log` skill |
| **Findings** | From round 003: `docs/rounds/NNN/findings.md` | Question, Finding, Method, Results, Decision, Evidence, Claim boundary, Open items | One per round |
| **Round trail** (from round 003) | `docs/rounds/NNN/trail/`: `journal.md`, `interview.md`, `plan-vK.md`, `critique-K.md`, `review-K.md` | Append-only journal (one row per event, occurred and recorded times); exact drafts as sent; raw critiques verbatim | Written by the `round-log` skill as each event happens. Not read for implementing; each item is summarised and linked from `architecture.md` or `findings.md`. Checked with `python3 tools/round_log_check.py NNN` |
| **Proposals** (work without a round) | `docs/proposals/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<topic>.md`, trail in `<proposal>-trail/` next to it | Goal, problem, change, Second opinion table | Written before the work |
| **Implementation** | The code, tests and README | A `built` journal row names the commit subject; its Record is the main paths changed | Verification commands go in the round's Tests section and the README |

The project has no environment registry or paper ledgers; the round-log steps for those do not apply.
