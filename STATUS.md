# ParaLLang status

The entry point for agents: the current state, how the project is logged, and the round index.

## Current state (2026-10-31)

- **Built.** The Phase 2 Language Engine loop at The Coffee Cart in The Crumbling Market: Gerald the Imp's
  encounter, companion help, the Spellbook and spaced review ([round 001](docs/rounds/001/architecture.md)). It is
  playable through a Codex or Claude Code subscription CLI ([round 002](docs/rounds/002/architecture.md)).
- **Design sources.** [`parallang.md`](parallang.md) (vision and lore), [`prototype.md`](prototype.md) (technical
  blueprint) and [`parallang_obsidian/`](parallang_obsidian/Parallang.md), the owner's Obsidian notes on design,
  lore, characters, locations and quests. The notes are a copy of the vault in `~/Documents/Parallang`, taken
  2026-10-31.
- **Next.** Round 003 is the first round recorded with the round log.

## How the project is logged

| Record | Where | Form | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Status** | This file | Current state, dated addenda (newest first) and the round index | One addendum per piece of work |
| **Design decisions** | `docs/rounds/NNN/architecture.md` | Goal, owner decisions, Second opinion, design, tests (pre-run); dated Amendments, Status and Outcome | Rounds 001–002 ran through the round pipeline (`packet.md`, `implement.md`, `audit-1`, `fix-1`, `verify-1`, `round.json`). From round 003, conversational rounds are recorded with the `round-log` skill |
| **Findings** | From round 003: `docs/rounds/NNN/findings.md` | Question, Finding, Method, Results, Decision, Evidence, Claim boundary, Open items | One per round |
| **Round trail** (from round 003) | `docs/rounds/NNN/trail/`: `journal.md`, `interview.md`, `plan-vK.md`, `critique-K.md`, `review-K.md` | Append-only journal (one row per event, occurred and recorded times); exact drafts as sent; raw critiques verbatim | Written by the `round-log` skill as each event happens. Not read for implementing; each item is summarised and linked from `architecture.md` or `findings.md`. Checked with `python3 tools/round_log_check.py NNN` |
| **Proposals** (work without a round) | `docs/proposals/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<topic>.md`, trail in `<proposal>-trail/` next to it | Goal, problem, change, Second opinion table | Written before the work |
| **Implementation** | The code, tests and README | A `built` journal row names the commit subject; its Record is the main paths changed | Verification commands go in the round's Tests section and the README |

The project has no environment registry or paper ledgers; the round-log steps for those do not apply.

## Round index
